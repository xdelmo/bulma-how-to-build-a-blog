- How to divide page into columns with CSS Grid and create identifiers to use them into other classes

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: [xl-start] 1fr 1.5rem [md-start] minmax(
      0,
      624px
    ) [md-end] 1.5rem 1fr [xl-end];
}

.grid * {
  grid-column: md;
}

.grid-xl {
  grid-column: xl;
}
```
